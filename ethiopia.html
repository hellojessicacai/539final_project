            <h1>Ethiopia</h1>
            <p>For centuries, Ethiopia has maintained a rich tradition of coffee production, tracing back many years. It is the birthplace of Coffea arabica, the coffee plant, which has since been cultivated in diverse regions worldwide. Ethiopia plays a significant role in the global coffee market, contributing approximately 17% to its overall output.</p>

            <p>Coffee holds a crucial position in Ethiopia's economy, constituting around 30-35% of foreign income. An estimated 15 million people in the country depend on various aspects of coffee production for their livelihoods. In 2013, coffee exports alone generated $300 million, accounting for 24% of that year's total exports.</p>

            <p>Coffee beans from Ethiopia cultivated in regions such as Harar, Yirgacheffe, Limu, Jimma, or Kaffa are distinctly separated and promoted under their respective regional names. These regional varieties are designated as trademarked names, with Ethiopia holding the rights to their ownership.</p>
