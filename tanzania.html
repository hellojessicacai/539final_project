            <h1>Tanzania</h1>
            <p>Tanzania's coffee sector ranks as the 19th largest global producer. In 2006 alone, Tanzania yielded more than fifty-five million pounds of coffee beans. The annual coffee exports contribute significantly, generating over $60 million for the Tanzanian economy. Despite the long-standing coffee history in East Africa, widespread cultivation in the region that now constitutes modern-day Tanzania did not commence until the early 1900s.</p>

            <p>Similar to many East African arabica coffees, high-quality Tanzanian coffees are characterized by a distinct acidity. These coffees typically boast a medium to full body, offering a rich and flavorful profile.</p>

            <p>Tanzanian coffee is frequently sorted, leading to the separate sale of peaberry beans and flat beans. Notably, in the United States, the majority of coffee labeled as Tanzanian is sourced from peaberry beans.</p>
