            <h1>Kenya</h1>
            <p>Kenyan coffee is renowned for its vibrant and robust flavor, accompanied by a distinctive wine-like acidity. Cultivated at elevated altitudes on the slopes of Mount Kenya and in various central and western regions of the country, Kenyan coffee adopts the innovative "sloped land technology" method. This technique entails terracing hillsides to establish a more stable and conducive growing environment.</p>

            <p>The meticulous process begins with hand-harvesting the coffee cherries, followed by employing the wet method during processing. The wet method involves meticulously removing the outer layers of the cherry to unveil the beans within. Subsequently, the beans undergo post-harvest processing and curing before being dispatched to traders and roasteries worldwide.</p>

            <p>Kenya stands as the foremost coffee producer in Africa, playing a pivotal role in the country's economy. With coffee contributing to approximately 20% of Kenya's export revenues, it holds the position of the nation's third-largest export commodity.</p>
