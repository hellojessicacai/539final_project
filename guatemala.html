            <h1>Guatemala</h1>
            <p>Coffee production in Guatemala began to develop in the 1850s. Coffee is an important element of Guatemala's economy.</p>

            <p>Guatemala's coffee beans commonly exhibit tasting notes that suggest a full-bodied profile with a pronounced chocolate-cocoa flavor and a sweetness reminiscent of toffee. These coffees from Guatemala truly represent the distinctive characteristics found in Central American coffees.</p>

            <p>Specifically, the green coffees produced in the Atitlan and Antigua coffee growing regions in Guatemala's central highlands, known as Strictly Hard Bean, showcase these qualities, along with a floral acidity that often carries spicy or chocolaty undertones.</p>
