            <h1>Mexico</h1>
            <p>Mexico holds the position of the world's eighth-largest coffee producer, yielding 252,000 tonnes in 2009. The primary focus of coffee cultivation in Mexico is in the south-central to southern regions of the country. Predominantly of the arabica variety, coffee thrives notably well in the coastal region of Soconusco, Chiapas, near the Guatemala border.</p>

            <p>The introduction of coffee to Mexico occurred at the end of the 18th century, originating from the Antilles, but it did not witness substantial export quantities until the 1870s. In the 1980s, coffee emerged as Mexico's most valuable export crop. Presently, Mexico stands as the leading source of coffee imports for the United States. Noteworthy coffee beans from Mexico include Altura, Liquidambar MS, and Pluma Coixtepec.</p>
